                <h3>Starting with HTML</h3>
                <p class="post-meta">Published on April 12, 2023 • 5 min read</p>
                <p>Today I began learning HTML. It's fascinating to see how websites are structured with various tags
                    and elements. I started with the basic structure of an HTML document and learned about headings,
                    paragraphs, links, and images.</p>
                <p>What I found most interesting is how semantic HTML helps with accessibility and SEO. Using elements
                    like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; makes the page structure clearer
                    for both browsers and developers.</p>

                <h3>CSS Makes Everything Beautiful</h3>
                <p class="post-meta">Published on April 15, 2023 • 7 min read</p>
                <p>I started learning CSS today. It's amazing how just a few lines of code can completely transform a
                    webpage's appearance. I experimented with colors, fonts, spacing, and basic layout techniques.</p>
                <p>The box model was initially confusing, but after practicing with padding, borders, and margins, it
                    started to make sense. I also learned about different units of measurement (px, em, rem, %) and when
                    to use each.</p>

                <h3>My First Responsive Design</h3>
                <p class="post-meta">Published on April 18, 2023 • 8 min read</p>
                <p>Today I created my first responsive website that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Media
                    queries are powerful! I learned how to adjust layouts, font sizes, and even hide certain elements
                    based on screen size.</p>
                <p>I also discovered the importance of mobile-first design. Starting with the mobile layout and then
                    adding media queries for larger screens seems to be the most efficient approach.</p>

                <h3>The Power of Flexbox</h3>
                <p class="post-meta">Published on April 22, 2023 • 6 min read</p>
                <p>I've been diving deeper into CSS layout techniques, and Flexbox has been a game-changer. Creating
                    complex layouts with just a few properties is incredible.</p>
                <p>I practiced with justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction properties. The Froggy Flexbox game
                    was really helpful for understanding these concepts in a fun way.</p>
